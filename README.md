#  Clima


## What I created

I made a beautiful, dark-mode enabled weather app. Here you can to check the weather for the current location based on the GPS data from the iPhone as well as by searching for a city manually. 

## What I Used

* Dark-mode enabled app.
* Used vector images as image assets.
* Use the UITextField to get user input. 
* Use delegate pattern.
* Swift protocols and extensions. 
* Swift computed properties.
* Swift closures and completion handlers.
* Use URLSession to network and make HTTP requests.
* Parse JSON with the native Encodable and Decodable protocols. 
* Use Core Location to get the current location from the phone GPS.
